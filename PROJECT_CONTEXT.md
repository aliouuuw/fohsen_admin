# KeurSant√© LMS Admin Platform - Project Context & Development Plan

## Overview

This is the **administrative management platform** for KeurSant√©, a local-first mobile learning platform designed for Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Senegal. While the mobile app serves CHWs directly with training content, this admin platform enables instructors, administrators, and content creators to manage the entire learning ecosystem.

## Mobile App Context (What We're Supporting)

The KeurSant√© mobile app serves CHWs (ages 27‚Äì30, bilingual French/Wolof, tech-savvy) with:
- **Offline-first learning**: Video lectures with downloadable text alternatives
- **Modular training**: Small sections with comprehension tests between modules
- **Interactive elements**: Quizzes, simulations, practical scenarios
- **Community forums**: Peer-to-peer interaction with tutor moderation
- **Cultural relevance**: Senegal-specific health scenarios and local examples
- **Bilingual support**: French/Wolof language switching
- **Progress tracking**: Individual analytics and shareable digital certificates
